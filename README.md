## Project Overview: Data Visualization Track

### *Project Description*

This project focuses on telling a story using data visualizations. Our group chose to explore `Endangered Languages`. We aimed to uncover insights and trends within the data and present them through interactive visualizations. Our project includes a variety of visualizations created using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, and Plotly. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and extracted using SQLAlchemy. 

## Installation and Usage

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and PostgreSQL installed.
- Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
- Run the Flask application using python app.py.
- Access the web application through your browser and interact with the visualizations.
  
## Project Details

1. **Data and Delivery**:  
 - `Dataset Creation`: Utilize data from various sources to compile a dataset containing at least 100 unique records. 
 - `Database Setup`: Create a database using PostgreSQL to store the dataset. Design the database schema to efficiently organize and manage the data.

2. **Visualizations**: Create four CSV files based on the transformed data:
 - `Unique Views Creation`: Develop at least three distinct visualizations to present the data. These visualizations should offer different perspectives on the dataset and highlight various insights.
 - `Clear Presentation`: Ensure that the visualizations are presented in a clear and easily understandable manner. Use appropriate labels, titles, and colors to enhance readability and comprehension.
 - `Interpretability`: Design the visualizations to be easily interpretable by users of all levels. Provide explanations or tooltips where necessary to clarify any complex or unfamiliar aspects of the data.

3. **Usability**:
  - `Error-Free Showcase`: Create a script, notebook, or webpage to showcase the data visualizations. Test the functionality thoroughly to ensure that it runs without errors on different platforms and browsers.
  - `Library Integration`: Incorporate a Python or JavaScript library not covered in class to enhance the project's functionality and visual appeal. This library should complement the existing tools and contribute to the overall user experience.
  - `User-Driven Interaction`:
       - HTML/JavaScript: Implement menus, dropdowns, or textboxes on the webpage to allow users to interact with the visualizations dynamically. Use JavaScript to update the visualizations based on user inputs.
       - Flask API: Develop interactive API routes using Flask to serve back Python or JavaScript-created plots. Enable users to request specific data subsets or customize the visualizations according to their preferences.
       - Filtered Data Visualization: Enable users to select and filter the data interactively, guiding them through the process step by step. Provide intuitive controls and feedback to enhance the user experience.
